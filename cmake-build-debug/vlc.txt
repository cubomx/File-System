VideoLAN is an organization with not lucrative purpose. In its origins it was planned to be two separated programs: VideoLAN Client and VideoLAN Server. It all started as an project of sutdents at the École Centrale Paris. After it was published it with a GNU GP License as an open source software. Every can see the code of the project. Time later, they decided to include a great variety of the implementations made in the program of VideoLAN Server into the the VideoLAN Client, they merged and the result was the program that most people known as the VLC media player, with millions of user around the world.

After the code was released for the global public (precisely the developer public and community), the project grew up quickly and people from approximately 40 nations got involved for the continuous development of the project and its maintenance. Ten years after it was stipulated that it was just a project, it become the organization we know today. The selfsame president of the organization is also part of one active developer member of the organization.

Lately there's was an annoying issue for the developers involved in the VLC organization. Some users had found and downloaded the VLC programs from other sources that have been modified by other websites: the programs that this websites offer to the public are combined with other minor software that they users doesn't know they are accepting to download it when downloading the VLC programs not from the web page of the organization. VLC hasn't money to bring down those websites which are violating their principles and adding unwanted programs to the VLC program.
